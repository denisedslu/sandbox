#### Process

1. Wrangle data, figure out what would be the best way to visualize it. I decided to go with a chart and not a map so that users will be able to see all countries clearly.
2. Why scatterplot? Because there is missing data from year to year, and every year has data from different countries, it would be hard to draw a trend using a line chart. Simply plotting the points would be enough to display the data.
3. Deal with the shape of the raw data. I combined both the Facebook and Google data sets into one, so users could compare the two together and more easily see differences.
