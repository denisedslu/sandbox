			<p>I’m finding it difficult to say goodbye to Northwestern. Not because I know I’ll miss it, but because I worry I won’t. There came a point in the middle of Winter Quarter, when I was away from campus on JR, toying with the idea of cutting and running, leaving my Slavic minor incomplete and never returning. But the idea of not being a student anymore scared the shit out of me. I guess it still does, though coming back has made me realize I’m not terribly good at student life anymore. I like my weekends free and my bedtimes early. I can barely motivate myself to go to my two classes. I feel old.</p><p>What am I coming away with after four years and $150,000? A certain haggard look. An awareness of my limitations (and what sleep-deprivation hallucinations look like). A random smattering of incomplete knowledge of Russian history, Latin American politics and Middle English. Best friends. A promise of future employment.</p><p>By all calculations, Northwestern has done me well. Yet I find it hard to look back on my time spent here and think, aha, I’ve been doing it right.</p><p>I never regretted my choice to go to Northwestern. I used to walk around campus, as a doe-eyed freshman seeing a real Midwestern Fall for the first time and feeling so satisfied that I hadn’t made a mistake in coming here. And I still think that. I can’t imagine having gone anywhere else. So where is my sense of closure? I feel terrified to leave this place, even though in truth I’ve been halfway out the door since the first day of spring classes.</p>

			<p>I wonder what I would do differently, if I could. Maybe nothing. The couple quarters I spent proving my own clumsiness on the Frisbee team? I’ll never be an athlete, but in those months I was stronger than I’ll likely ever be again. Thinking about the miserable year I spent hating my life as a member of a mismanaged exec board still gives me heartburn, but it will probably give me fodder for job interviews for years to come. The hours I poured into the back end of this website took away from the things I was actually paying to learn, but taught me more than Medill ever could.</p><p>Perhaps I’ll regret all the times I avoided saying "Hi" to acquaintances on Sheridan Road or all the people I thought were cool but never earnestly tried to befriend. I should probably regret the time I spent holed up in my bed watching Netflix. I might regret living in a "brothel."</p><p>I guess I regret that I don’t feel the impending loss of my identity as a Northwestern student more deeply, maybe because my ties to campus have thinned over the years, and I haven’t worked hard enough to strengthen them. But the experiences that have made my Northwestern experience great won’t disappear the moment I take off that sweaty graduation gown. I’d like to think I’ve learned some stuff, even if those things weren’t on my syllabi.</p><p>So see you later, Northwestern. It was great, except the times when it wasn’t. In a few years, when life stretches endlessly before me with nary a spring break in sight, I’m sure I’ll miss you.</p>
